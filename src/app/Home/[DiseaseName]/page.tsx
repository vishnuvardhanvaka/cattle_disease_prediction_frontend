            Udder abnormalities: Swelling, hardness, redness, heat, or pain in the affected quarter(s) of the udder
            Systemic symptoms in severe cases: Fever, reduced appetite, weakness, shock`,
            cause: `Bacterial infection: Most commonly caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli,
            and others. These bacteria can enter the udder through the teat canal.
            Less commonly: Fungal infections, yeast infections, viruses, or physical trauma to the udder.`,

            img_src: "/bloat.png",
            description: `Bloat is a serious condition in cattle characterized by an overdistention of the rumen (the first stomach compartment). This distention is caused by a buildup of gas that the animal is unable to expel. Bloat can be fatal if not treated quickly and effectively.`,
            symptoms: `Marked distension of the left abdomen. This is the most prominent sign. The abdomen may be drum-like 
            and feel hard to the touch.
            Discomfort and restlessness. The animal may kick at its belly, grunt, or bellow.
            Difficulty breathing.
            Rapid heart rate.
            Collapse and death in severe cases.`,
            cause: `Bloat has two main types, each with different causes:
            Frothy Bloat: Occurs when gas becomes trapped in a stable foam within the rumen. This often stems from diets high in legumes 
            like alfalfa or clover. These plants have components that promote the formation of this gas-trapping foam.
            Free-Gas Bloat: Occurs when there's a physical obstruction preventing gas release, such as choking, an enlarged lymph node, 
            or issues with the nerves controlling the esophagus.`,
            precautions: `Gradual dietary changes. If introducing high-risk forages like legumes, do so slowly, allowing the rumen to adjust.
            Bloat preventatives. Poloxalene is a common additive in feed or mineral blocks to help prevent frothy bloat.
            Ionophores (for feedlot cattle). Ionophores like monensin help regulate rumen fermentation and can decrease bloat risk.
            Avoid grazing lush, wet legume pastures. Risk is especially high if they are covered in dew or shortly after a frost.
            Consider bloat resistant alfalfa varieties.`,
            cure: `Urgent treatment is critical. Time is of the essence with bloat.
            Frothy Bloat: Treatment involves a stomach tube to break down the foam and allow gas to escape. Anti-foaming agents (like vegetable oil or commercial products) are often administered through the tube.
            Free-Gas Bloat: Relieving the obstruction is key. This may be possible with a stomach tube in some cases, or might require surgery for more complex obstructions.
            
            ** Veterinary attention is ALWAYS required for bloat. Do not attempt to treat this yourself.
Bloat can occur suddenly and even with preventative measures in place. Be observant of your cattle, especially when grazing high-risk forages.

            cause: `Ingestion of oocysts: Cattle become infected by swallowing Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (the parasite's egg-like stage).
            Fecal-oral transmission: Oocysts are shed in huge numbers in the feces of infected animals. Contaminated feed, water,
             or surfaces can spread the infection.
            Zoonotic potential: Cryptosporidium can also infect humans, causing similar diarrheal illness.`,
            precautions: `Hygiene: Strict hygiene practices are crucial, including cleaning and disinfecting calving areas, equipment, and boots.

            cause: `Reduced Abomasal Motility: Decreased contractions of abomasum muscles can lead to gas accumulation and displacement.
            Dietary Factors: Sudden changes in feed, high concentrate diets with low fiber, insufficient feed intake.
            Post-calving: The uterus displaces the abomasum during pregnancy. After calving, the abomasum may not return to its
             normal position correctly.

            Concurrent Illnesses: Diseases like metritis, milk fever, mastitis, etc., that reduce appetite and overall cow health can increase the risk of DA.`,

            Rolling: Veterinarians may physically roll the cow to reposition the abomasum.
            Toggling: Inserting a toggle suture to help anchor the abomasum in the correct position (reduces recurrence risk).
            Surgical:
            Right Flank Abomasopexy: Fixing the abomasum to the abdominal wall.
            Omentopexy: Fixing the abomasum to the omentum (a fatty membrane within the abdomen).
            Pyloropexy: Fixing the abomasum near the pylorus.

            Unexplained diarrhea
            Liver abscesses`,
            cause: `High-grain diets: Cattle are built to digest fibrous forages. When they consume too much grain or other rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, the rumen microbes produce excessive amounts of acid.
            Sudden dietary changes: Abruptly introducing high grain levels without rumen adaptation can trigger acidosis.
            Insufficient fiber: Fiber stimulates chewing and saliva production (which has natural buffering properties). Lack of fiber lowers rumen pH.
            Management factors: Feeding schedules that lead to inconsistent intake patterns ("slug feeding") or allowing cattle to sort their feed and avoid fiber increase risks.`,
            precautions: `Gradual dietary changes: Transition cattle to higher grain proportions slowly over several weeks to allow their rumen to adapt.
            Adequate fiber: Ensure the diet includes sufficient amounts of effective fiber (from forages) to promote rumination and healthy rumen function.
            Feed additives: Buffering agents can help stabilize rumen pH.
            Consistent feeding: Maintain regular feeding schedules to minimize fluctuations in rumen conditions.
            Avoid feed sorting: Manage feed to prevent cattle from avoiding the less desirable but necessary long fiber portions.`,

            Address underlying issues: Manage health conditions that may contribute to decreased feed intake.
            
            ** Acetonaemia can be subclinical (no obvious symptoms but compromised performance). Regular ketone testing of high-risk cows helps early detection.
            Prevention is critical. Good nutrition and management reduce the risk considerably.
            Always consult a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.`

            description: `A metabolic disorder in which excessive fat builds up in the liver of dairy cattle, commonly during the early stages of lactation. This buildup impairs liver function, potentially leading to serious health complications.`,
            symptoms: `Reduced appetite
            Significant decrease in milk production
            Lethargy and weakness
            Weight loss
            Jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin)
            Fatty, pale feces
            Neurological signs (e.g., staggering, head pressing) in severe cases`,
            cause: `Negative energy balance: When cattle experience a shortage of energy intake compared to their needs 
            (often right after giving birth), their bodies start excessively breaking down stored fat.
            Fat overload: The mobilized fat floods the liver. The liver can process some fat, but becomes overwhelmed in fatty liver syndrome.
            Fat accumulation: The excess fat gets deposited and stored in the liver as triglycerides, causing a buildup.
            Impaired function: This fatty accumulation disrupts normal liver processes like detoxification, metabolism, and energy production.`,
            precautions: `Balanced feed in the transition period: Provide carefully formulated diets to cows before and after giving birth to help them maintain a proper energy balance.
            Prevent overconditioning: Avoid having cows become overweight during their dry period, as this increases their risk.
            Gradual dietary changes: Introduce any changes to a cow's feed slowly to minimize metabolic stress.
            Monitor body condition: Regularly assess the body condition of cows, especially during the transition period.`,
            cure: `Early intervention: Treatment is most successful when started early in the disease.
            Supportive care: Focus on providing fluids, electrolytes, and nutritional support (glucose, propylene glycol) to help the cow regain energy balance.
            Lipotropic agents: These substances help the liver metabolize and export accumulated fat.
            Specific medications: Consult your veterinarian as medications targeted to liver function may be recommended.
            Address underlying conditions: Treat any concurrent health issues that may be contributing to the problem.
            
            ** Fatty liver syndrome can be life-threatening. Consult a veterinarian immediately if you suspect this condition in your cattle.
            Prevention is key â focusing on proper feeding practices and body condition management is crucial.`

            Loss of appetite
            Increased respiratory rate
            Eye discharge`,
            cause: `Calf pneumonia is a multifactorial disease, meaning it has multiple causes that interact:

            Viruses: Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Parainfluenza-3 (PI3), Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1, the cause of IBR), and
             Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV).
            Bacteria: Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma species.
            Stress factors: These increase a calf's susceptibility to infection and include:
            Weaning
            Transport
            Mixing with calves of different ages
            Poor ventilation
            Extreme temperatures
            Overcrowding`,
            precautions: `Vaccination: Vaccinate calves against the common viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia.
            Minimize stress: Reduce stressors as much as possible, especially around weaning and transport.
            Good ventilation Ensure sheds and housing have adequate airflow.
            Isolate sick animals: Prevent the spread of disease by quickly isolating calves showing pneumonia symptoms.
            Colostrum management: Ensure calves receive enough high-quality colostrum after birth to boost immunity.
            Biosecurity: Maintain good hygiene practices to limit disease spread.`,
            cure: `Antibiotics: Treatment often involves antibiotics to target the bacterial infections. Your veterinarian will choose the right antibiotic based on the likely pathogens involved.
            Supportive care: This may include:
            Anti-inflammatories to reduce fever and pain
            Rehydration therapy if the calf is dehydrated
            Nutritional support
            
            ** Early detection and treatment are vital. The earlier you catch pneumonia, the better the calf's chances for recovery.

            Distended neck veins
            Anxiety and restlessness`,
            cause: `Diet change: The sudden shift from low-protein to high-protein feed (usually lush pasture) triggers a biochemical change in the 
            rumen (first stomach of cattle).
            Tryptophan conversion: L-tryptophan, an amino acid abundant in lush pastures, is converted by rumen bacteria into 
            3-methylindole (3-MI).
            Lung Damage: 3-MI is absorbed and damages cells lining the lungs, leading to inflammation, breathing difficulties, and 
            potentially death.`,
            precautions: `Gradual transition: When moving cattle to lush pasture, introduce them gradually over several days or weeks.
            Supplementation: Hay or other low-protein feed alongside lush pasture can help balance the diet.
            At-risk awareness: Be particularly cautious with older cows and those that have been on poor-quality feed for extended periods.`,
            cure: `Oxygen support: Veterinarians may administer oxygen to aid breathing.
            Anti-inflammatories: Medications may be used to reduce inflammation in the lungs.
            Removal from pasture: Moving affected cattle back to dry feed MAY be considered but is debated as it could worsen the stress on the animal.
